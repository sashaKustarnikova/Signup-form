This project is a simple responsive registration form created with HTML and CSS. 

I used CSS custom properties for reducing repetition in CSS, and also for powerful runtime effects like theme switching and potentially extending/polyfilling future CSS features.

Code was validated by https://validator.w3.org/ and there are no errors or warnings to show.
